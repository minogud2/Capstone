    "### 1. Background\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This project adopts the facility location problem to the school network in Ethiopia to expand access to secondary education. Of the 40,776 schools in the country, 37,039 offer primary education, but only 3,737 offer secondary. On average, primary schools are located more than 7km away from the nearest secondary school, meaning children face long journeys or they don't access secondary at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expansion of secondary education is a major priority for the Ministry of Education, Ethiopia. Ambitious five year targets are set in the Education Sector Development Plans (ESDP). In 2013/2014, the Gross Enrollment Rate (GER) for lower secondary was 38.9% (3,466,972/8,914,837 children) and a target of 74% (6,596,979/8,914,837 children) was set. However, by 2019/2020, the actual GER was 51.05% (4,551,024/8,914,837 children), a more modest increase of 12.15% rather than 35.1%.  In the latest five year ESDP (2020/2021-2024/2025), an increase of 24% was set, but under the key-performance indicator of 'Number of newly established secondary schools', it says TBD- for 'To Be Determined'. Therein lies part of the problem: planning. Often, a portion of the budget is allocated for secondary, then each region decides how and where to spend it. Planners then, at the macro level, identify primary schools with the highest demand (i.e. largest enrollment) and seek to construct schools to serve that particular school population. While this can often yeild good results, the goal of this project is to improve on this approach in a way that allows for the potential construction of secondary schools across a catchment of multiple primary schools, if enrollment is sufficient and distance is minimal. Meta-heuristic optimisation techniques are used to achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project makes use of readily available data from the Ministry of Education, Ethiopia, mainly 1) enrollment data from the Education Managament Information System (EMIS) and 2) geolocation data, recently obtained from the World Bank in 2020. Since national population and census data is inaccurate and outdated in Ethiopia, this was not considered a reliable source for this project. Instead, it is assumed that primary schools are located within the community and new secondary schools should therefore be constructed close to existing primary schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In the problem, there is a list of existing primary schools and secondary schools in Ethiopia, their enrollment and location data (region, zone, district, longitude and latitude). The aim is to expand the secondary school network by constructing new secondary schools that best serve the demand from the existing primary school network. No limit is placed on capacity as this is determined by budget which is not known in advance and subject to change (**TO BE CONFIRMED**). Key to solving the problem is understanding that when a school is located within a village, there is no impact of distance on enrolment nor dropout. However, beyond the aspirational norm of 1-2km, distance affects initial access to school but also creates barriers to retention, completion and transition to higher level. As such, the aim is to minimise distance, but construct schools in locations with the highest demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Glossary of terms</b>\n",
    "* PS: Primary Schools\n",
    "* SS: Secondary Schools\n",
    "* EE: Expected Enrollment\n",
    "* EEI: Expected Enrollment Increase\n",
    "* Feeder: a primary school that is part of the secondary school catchment area.\n",
    "* x: proposed new secondary schools (the genotype).\n",
    "* d: distance in km between primary schools and \n",
    "* proposed_schools: the total number of schools proposed for construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution proposes new SS locations that can provide the highest estimated enrollment from feeder PS whilst also ensuring they are constructed within at minimal distance. Given the multitude of different languages and the decentralised Government of Ethiopia, models are developed at a regional level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two different algorithms are used in this project to find an optimal solution: Random Search, and CMA-ES (**description to follow**). In each of the algorithms, the objective function f() aims to <b> maximise overall expected enrollment </b> given a set of feasible locations: x. Feasibility of the locations or the genotype, x, is controlled using a box boundary of longitudes and latitudes for a given region. Initial starting points are also provided within the box boundary using a generate_random_sp() helper function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fitness is determined using an expected_enrollment function. This takes in the parameters: 1) the location of existing PS, 2) the enrollment of existing PS, 3) x, and 4) the current distance between existing PS and existing SS. The function then calculates the haversine distance in kilometers (km) between each new SS in x and all PS within a given region. This vector, <b> d </b>, is of size: (proposed_schools, len(ps)). Using this data, the algorithm then addresses three key challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **The need to identify the PS with the minimal distance to the new SS**. In this case, if a PS is close to two or more new SS, only the closest is selected. But if the PS is closer to an existing SS, then it's ignored as it's already a feeder school to the existing SS.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **The need to estimate the expected enrollment of the new SS, based on the distance to its feeder PS**. If a school is beyond a certain threshold distance in km, then the PS should not be considered a feeder school for a SS. To handle this, situation, a helper function is used to estimate the expected enrollment from a feeder PS to the nearby SS. It takes in as parameters a) distance to nearest SS and b) PS enrollment. It then makes some assumptions about distance to return the expected enrollment per school. Theunynck (2014) recommends the adoptation of a norm of 2 or 3km for junior secondary schools and the function therefore assumes that if a school is constructed within 2km of a PS, there is no negative effect on expected enrollment of it's nearby SS. Above 2km, a linear dropoff is assumed between 2-5km. If a PS is located more than 5km away from the new location proposed, it is expected that zero students will attend from that feeder school.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **The need to divert expected enrollment from a PS if it is currently a feeder school to an existing SS but the new SS proposed is closer**. This is dealt with by subtracting the expected enrollment from the PS to the existing SS using the shape function, and then allocating it to the new SS which is closer. \n",
    "\n",
    "A fitness evaluation budget of 10,000 is set to ensure there are sufficient iterations to achieve convergance. Each algorithm is run 30 times with different random starting points. The results are stored in a csv file, with the top 4 results plotted below. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It is assumed that 1km is equivalent to a 15 minute walk for children (Theunynck, S. 2014: p6).\n",
    "2. Distance is calculated using the haversine function and as a result distance is calculated as a straight line. The travel distances could therefore be further. Ethiopia is not well mapped and since most children are walking to school using other means like Google Maps API don't yeild useful results on a large scale and don't factor in more informal walking routes. Final results require close inspection for elevation and other issues that might impact walking distance or construction e.g. buildings, rivers. The final results should therefore be observed as an approximation and using a tool like ArcGIS or QGIS, the the results are observed for these types of obstacles. \n",
    "3. It is assumed that children beyond 5km are not likely to attend, but in some cases, this is not true. Some children walk extremely long distances to attend secondary school, while others stay with relatives or family friends to attend a school that is beyond 5km. Despite this being a reality, this shouldn't guide the construction as the goal is to minimise distance and create more equitable access to secondary. "
